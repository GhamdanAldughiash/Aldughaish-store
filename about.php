              <p class="w-50 mx-auto">
              <span>Our mission is to find the purest, most delicious, raw honey from Yemen and other countries
                 around the world. We’re dedicated to everything raw honey – from exquisite single-origin,
                  mono-floral honey, to potent honey fusions to irresistible combinations of raw honey and the
                   finest chocolate. Our flagship product is Hadrami Sidr, the mono-floral honey which comes 
                   from the bees that feed exclusively on the nectar of the Sidr tree. This ancient tree grows 
                   uncultivated in the remote mountains that climb up from the Wadi Do’an in the Hadramaout region
                    of Yemen, some 1,000 kilometres inland from the coast of the Arabian Sea.</span>

              <h3>Our ethos</h3>
              <hr class="mx-auto">
              <p class="w-50 mx-auto">
              <span>Aldughiash understands the precious rarity of truly raw, pure honey. 
                Our quality control is stringent to ensure our trusted customers are receive the genuine product.
                 Our supply chains are very short as we deal directly with small beekeepers in Yemen and
                  throughout the world. We work closely with these artisans to protect their livelihoods, 
                  their traditional way of life and the sustainability of their work. All Aldughaish  honey 
                  is raw, straight from the hive with no heat-treatment or micro-filters which would rob it of 
                  the potent health promoting enzymes. None of our farmers or beekeepers feed sugar solution or 
                  supplements to their bees either. We are totally dedicated to finding the purest most natural 
                  honey there is. This attention to detail extends to any ingredients we use, such as the spices 
                  in our honey fusions.</span>
